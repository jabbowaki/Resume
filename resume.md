## Summary

For as long as I can remember, I've loved creating things, whether it be monstrous lego castles or hand knit hats. The urge to build clean and helpful things ultimately led me to programming. I'm looking for the opportunity to continue to learn and grow in an environment that is agile focused and encourages creativity.

## Projects
### [PairBnb](http://pairbnb.org/)

PairBnB is a social platform for programmers who are looking to network with, teach, learn from and host like-minded individuals (think Couchsurfing + AirBnB + Programming). Users can sign up, find other programmers in cities around the country, message each other, and request to pair-program on projects of their choice. In exchange for technical assistance, hosts can offer places to stay for users coming from out of town.
